## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-21

### Model and validation
- Validation criterion v2: a case passes when the best target neuron fires ≥ 3 spikes in the
  window in ≥ 2/3 of seeds and beats a size-matched random control (≥ 3× its rate + 2 Hz),
  with ≤ 100 self-sustained neurons; latencies reported. GF → DLMn excluded (gap junctions).
- `calibrate` re-derived the defaults with a pre-registered ranking: `th_jump` 6 mV, the one
  named compensation (adaptive threshold); the battery passes 16/16.
- `path --alt K`: further routes, each avoiding the intermediate cell types of the previous
  ones (LC4 → TTMn: via DNp01, then DNp02, then DNp11).

### 3D view (`flymsg viz`)
- Streams real neuron surfaces (multi-resolution Draco), skeletons and neuropils from the
  public GCS volumes; the export holds only metadata and activity.
- Octree LOD within a triangle budget derived from the GPU buffers' real capacity; neurons
  beyond it drawn as skeletons, simplified only below half a pixel on screen.
- One draw for all surfaces (`BatchedMesh`) and one for all skeletons; fragments finished in
  workers; GPU picking; render on demand; 4× MSAA at rest, adaptive quality while moving.
- Replays: silent neurons desaturated and see-through, so activity is not hidden.
- Performance HUD and `?bench=<s>`; `scripts/shoot.mjs` measures headless on SwiftShader or
  the real GPU. Numbers in [docs/viz.md](docs/viz.md).

### Docs
- `docs/data.md`, `docs/model.md`, `docs/validation.md` (with the negative results),
  `docs/viz.md`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-21

- `fetch` / `build`: MaleCNS v1.0 tables compacted to Parquet (165,122 traced neurons,
  25.6 M connections).
- `info`, `path` (strongest chain by input fraction), `sim` (whole-CNS LIF after Shiu et
  al. 2024, time-binned, multi-seed summary).
- `validate` battery of known circuits with controls, `calibrate` grid search.
